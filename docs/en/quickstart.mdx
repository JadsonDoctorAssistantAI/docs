## Creating your application

The first step to start using Doctor Assistant AI is to create your first application. By accessing the 
[dashboard](https://backoffice.doctorassistant.ai), you can create your first application and perform the initial 
configurations.

<Note>
You can have multiple applications, each with their own configurations, but usually only one is necessary.
</Note>

## Execution environments

When creating your application, it will already have access to the **Sandbox** and **Production** execution environments, 
so you don't need to worry about creating more applications to test the platform.

- **Sandbox**: Development environment, where you can test and validate the application's functionalities.
- **Production**: Production environment, where the application runs in production and is accessed by real users.

In the [dashboard](https://backoffice.doctorassistant.ai), to switch between environments, you can click the environment toggle button, which is located 
in the upper right corner of the page.

<Warning>
  Any usage made in the production environment will enable billing for platform usage.
</Warning>

## Configuring your application

There are some configuration aspects that are necessary for your application to work correctly.
All these configurations can be made in the [dashboard](https://backoffice.doctorassistant.ai) in the 
settings tab of your application, which can be accessed through the left sidebar menu.

### Webhooks

The first one is webhook configuration. Webhooks are events that Doctor Assistant AI sends to your application, 
such as when a consultation is processed and completed.

To configure webhook reception, you must provide one or more URLs that accept **HTTP POST** requests, where 
Doctor Assistant AI can send the events. It's important that the URL is publicly accessible and that it returns 
a **200** status, so that Doctor Assistant AI can confirm that the event was received.

<Note>
  Doctor Assistant AI does not store events sent by webhooks, therefore, if you want to have a history of these events, 
  you must implement logic for this in your application.
</Note>

### APIs

Doctor Assistant AI has several APIs that can be used to interact with the platform. Access to them can be
enabled and disabled by accessing the APIs tab in your application's settings screen. Enable and disable the APIs you
want to use according to your application's needs.

    The consultation API allows you to send audio consultations to Doctor Assistant AI and receive their transcription, structured report
    and even a list of recommended medications for a prescription.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Exams" icon="file-medical">
    The exams API allows you to send exam files to Doctor Assistant AI and receive a structured document with all the values
    found in the exam.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Summary" icon="clipboard-list">
    The summary API allows you to send a consultation history and receive a detailed summary of all of them.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  When creating a new application, all APIs are disabled by default. You must enable the APIs you want to use.
</Note>

### Authentication

API keys are used to authenticate requests to Doctor Assistant AI's APIs. They are created automatically
when you create a new application, one key per environment, and can be found in the **Integration** tab in your application's settings screen.

<Warning>
  API keys are sensitive and should be stored securely in your environment.
