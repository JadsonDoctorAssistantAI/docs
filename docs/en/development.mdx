There are two ways to integrate Doctor Assistant AI into your application:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="APIs" icon="code">
    Integrate Doctor Assistant AI using our REST APIs to have full control over the user experience.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Web Components" icon="browser">
    Use our ready-to-use web components and have a quick and simplified integration.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using the APIs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Consultation API" icon="stethoscope">
    The consultation API allows you to send audio consultations to Doctor Assistant AI and receive their transcription, structured report
    and even a list of recommended medications for a prescription. This API is ideal for integrating Doctor Assistant AI into your
    electronic medical record system or telemedicine application.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exams API" icon="file-medical">
    The exams API allows you to send exam files to Doctor Assistant AI and receive a structured document with all the values
    found in the exam. With it you can automate the extraction of data from laboratory and imaging exams, facilitating the work
    of healthcare professionals.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Summary API" icon="clipboard-list">
    The summary API allows you to send a consultation history and receive a detailed summary of all of them. Ideal for having a
    consolidated view of the patient's history and assisting in clinical decision making.

## Event Webhooks

Our platform sends notifications via Webhook whenever certain actions occur. The Webhook is a POST sent to the URL configured in your application's dashboard. It is expected that your endpoint responds with an HTTP 2xx status to confirm receipt.

The payload sent will always be a JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "event": "CONSULTATION_SUCCESS", // string identifying the event
  "data": { /* variable content according to the resource */ },
  "error": {
    "message": "Error description, if any"
  }
}
```

- `event`: string that identifies the event type.
- `data`: object with the specific data of the resource (varies according to the API that originated the event and follows the same response format as the API in the GET verb).
- `error`: optional object, present only in failure cases, containing a descriptive error message.

### Available events

Currently, the following events can be received, organized by context:

#### Consultations
- `CONSULTATION_SUCCESS`: Consultation processed successfully.
- `CONSULTATION_FAILED`: An error occurred while processing the consultation.

#### Exams
- `EXAM_SUCCESS`: Exam processed successfully.
- `EXAM_FAILED`: An error occurred while processing the exam.

### Sending Strategies

When finishing processing a resource, we will try to send the webhook up to 5 times, using exponential intervals starting from 5 seconds between attempts. If all attempts fail and the webhook is not successfully integrated, we will make a new integration attempt every day at 10 PM, using the same resend mechanism. This daily process will continue until the webhook is successfully integrated (i.e., until we receive an HTTP 2xx response from your endpoint).

### Security

If you want to add a security layer based on the origin of Webhooks, configure your endpoint to accept requests originating from the host `35.193.128.22`, which is our platform's IP address for production.
